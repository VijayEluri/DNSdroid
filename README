DNSdroid : A DNS health checker for Android
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About:
The DNSdroid Android application is a DNS tester. Enter a domain name and it will check if all of your name servers work as correctly as you expected. The tests are based on the Swiss ccTLD .CH library.

Following test categories are included:

    * SOA
    * Delegation
    * Dnssec
    * Nameserver
    * Address (of name server)

New: A widget shows you the results of the periodical re-tested domains!
     Show if your current DNS resolver is DNS enabled.
     Share the test results by mail or an other messaging system. 

Note: All tests are performed on the device! No Web-Service is involved. This lets you also check your internal domains using the wireless capabilities of your mobile phone.

Install:
git clone git://github.com/sambenz/DNSdroid.git
cd DNSdroid.git && android update project -p .
